# Sokoban Game

A Python-based implementation of the classic Sokoban puzzle game using Pygame.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the robot.
- Push boxes onto target locations.
- The game is solved when all boxes are placed on target locations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sokoban.git

2. Install Pygame

   ```bash
   pip install pygame

3. Run the game
   ```bash
   python game.py


### Key Changes:
- **Virtual environment setup** (optional but recommended to avoid version conflicts with Python packages).
- **`requirements.txt`** step for installing dependencies (although if you're not using it, you can skip it).
- Updated the instructions to activate the environment and install `pygame` if needed.
- **Running the game**: Clearer instructions for running the `game.py` script.
